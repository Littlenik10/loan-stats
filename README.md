### üìù Project Overview:
A Lending Club loan dataset was analyzed using Excel for preprocessing and Tableau for interactive visualization. The goal was to identify patterns in borrower behavior, loan performance, and risk indicators to support better credit decision-making. Key attributes included loan amount, term, interest rate, borrower income, employment length, home ownership, debt-to-income ratio, and loan status.


### üß© Key Features of the Dashboard:   
#### 1. KPI Cards (Top Summary):   
- Median Loan Amount: RM13,000   
- Median Interest Rate: 13.65   
- Total Loan Amount: RM3.5 billion+   
- Median DTI (Debt-to-Income): 17.63   

#### 2. Loan Amount by Term (Bar Chart):   
- Compared short-term and long-term loan distributions to assess borrower preferences and risk segmentation. 
- Visualizes the percentage of total loan amount per term.   

#### 3. Loan Amount by Ownership (Horizontal Bar Chart):   
- Breaks down loan amounts by housing status (Rent, Own, Mortgage).   
- Helps identify which housing group borrows the most.   

#### 4. Loan Amount by Month (Area Chart):   
- Shows monthly loan issuance trends throughout 2014.   
- Peaks suggest high activity periods and can guide seasonal planning.   

#### 5.Loan Amount by DTI (Scatter Plot):   
- Analyzes the relationship between debt-to-income ratio and loan amount.   
- Visualizes risk levels ‚Äî very high or very low DTI values tend to associate with lower loan amounts.

### üîç Key Insight:   
One key takeaway was that lower-grade loans (like Grade D or E) were associated with higher interest rates and a higher likelihood of default, especially among borrowers with high DTI or low income. This has strong implications for credit risk modeling and lending policy.
