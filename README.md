### üìù Project Overview:
This dashboard was created to analyze loan performance data and uncover key insights into loan distribution, customer demographics, and financial behavior. It was built using Tableau as part of an academic business analytics project.

- Median Loan Amount: RM13,000   
- Median Interest Rate: 13.65   
- Total Loan Amount: RM3.5 billion+   
- Median DTI (Debt-to-Income): 17.63   

#### 2. Loan Amount by Term (Bar Chart):   
- Shows loan distribution between short and long-term loans.   
- Visualizes the percentage of total loan amount per term.   

#### 3. Loan Amount by Ownership (Horizontal Bar Chart):   
- Breaks down loan amounts by housing status (Rent, Own, Mortgage).   
- Helps identify which housing group borrows the most.   

#### 4. Loan Amount by Month (Area Chart):   
- Shows monthly loan issuance trends throughout 2014.   
- Peaks suggest high activity periods and can guide seasonal planning.   

#### 5.Loan Amount by DTI (Scatter Plot):   
- Analyzes the relationship between debt-to-income ratio and loan amount.   
- Visualizes risk levels ‚Äî very high or very low DTI values tend to associate with lower loan amounts.
