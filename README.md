### 📝 Project Overview:
This dashboard was created using Tableau to analyze loan amount trends across different variables such as loan term, home ownership, month of issuance, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. The goal was to identify patterns in loan distributions and highlight key financial indicators such as median loan amount, total loan volume, and interest rates.

### 🧩 Key Features of the Dashboard:   
#### 1. KPI Cards (Top Summary):   
- Median Loan Amount: RM13,000   
- Median Interest Rate: 13.65   
- Total Loan Amount: RM3.5 billion+   
- Median DTI (Debt-to-Income): 17.63   

#### 2. Loan Amount by Term (Bar Chart):   
- Shows loan distribution between short and long-term loans.   
- Visualizes the percentage of total loan amount per term.   

#### 3. Loan Amount by Ownership (Horizontal Bar Chart):   
- Breaks down loan amounts by housing status (Rent, Own, Mortgage).   
- Helps identify which housing group borrows the most.   

#### 4. Loan Amount by Month (Area Chart):   
- Shows monthly loan issuance trends throughout 2014.   
- Peaks suggest high activity periods and can guide seasonal planning.   

#### 5.Loan Amount by DTI (Scatter Plot):   
- Analyzes the relationship between debt-to-income ratio and loan amount.   
- Visualizes risk levels — very high or very low DTI values tend to associate with lower loan amounts.   

### ⚙️ Tools & Skills Used:
